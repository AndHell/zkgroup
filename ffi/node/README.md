# ZKGroups for Node.js

Node.js wrapper for the zkgroup rust crate.

## Rebuild the libzkgroup framework
```
make
```

## Test
```
make test
```

## Node.js
First make sure you're on the proper version of Node, currently 12.4.0. `nvm` is a useful tool; the project has an `.nvmrc` file to make it easy to use the proper version.
